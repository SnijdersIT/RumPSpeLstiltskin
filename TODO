right now all three scripts are kind of stupid, and have a lot of code in common

- make some kind of centralized configuration file
    - email addresses
    - pgp configuration
    - object names and autnum names
- common functions should go into some kind of lib
- use whois to check if the object has been parsed correctly
- use some rpslconfigcheck tool to validate the resulting code
- create generic data files which hold prefixes
- provide scripts to generate config for cisco / juniper etc
