This collection is meant to give some recommedations for network operators
regarding BGP standard bgp filters on eBGP and iBGP sessions. These scripts
can generate RPSL objects which can be used by rtconfig or rpsltool to create
prefix-lists which you deploy on your routers. 

It is inspired by Gert's page: 
    http://www.space.net/~gert/RIPE/ipv6-filters.html

Currently three filters can be created:

    - IPv6 Martian prefixes (example: fltr-martian-v6)
    - IPv6 Full Bogons list (example: fltr-bogons-v6)
    - IANA Allocated IPv6 prefixes (example: fltr-iana-allocated-v6)

The martian filter is a maintained by hand. It takes 'fltr-martian-v6.list' and
creates a RPSL object. 

The Full Bogons list is created based on data from Cymru.

The IANA Allocated IPv6 Prefixes list is created based on data from IANA.

I would really appriciate comments and contributions!
