This collection is meant to give some recommedations for network operators
regarding BGP standard bgp filters on eBGP and iBGP sessions. This list
can help to prevent incidents if people announce RFC1918 space or 
more-specifics from Peering LANS

It is inspired by Gert's page: 
    http://www.space.net/~gert/RIPE/ipv6-filters.html

The main differences between Gert's page and this repository are:
    - IPv4 also covered
    - Known IXP Peering LANs are included
